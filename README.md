# Vector_Database
Create Embeddings using Openai embeddings api 
store and query using Vector Database


# Vector Table
1) You wish to perform a semantic search on certain data;
2) You build a vector database that can store and process semantic search queries.
3) You analyze your data using OpenAI and turn it into vectors that you can store in a database.
4) You save the information and the vectors produced by OpenAI together.
5) You may now look up the data.

# Applications
Storing vectors and querying by sending vectors is a common technique used in various applications where similarity search or recommendation systems are required. Some notable applications include:

Semantic Search: You can store vectors representing documents, articles, or textual data and query for similar content. This is useful in search engines, content recommendation, and information retrieval systems.

Product Recommendations: E-commerce platforms use vector representations of products and customer preferences to provide personalized recommendations.

Image Retrieval: In image search engines, you can store vectors representing images and query for visually similar images.

Music Recommendation: In music streaming services, vectors representing songs and user preferences can be used to recommend music.

Anomaly Detection: In cybersecurity and network monitoring, vectors can be used to detect unusual patterns or behavior.

Natural Language Processing: Vectors representing words or phrases are used in applications like sentiment analysis, chatbots, and language translation.

Content Filtering: Social media platforms and news websites use vectors to filter and recommend content to users.

Collaborative Filtering: Vectors representing user profiles and item profiles are used for collaborative filtering in recommendation systems.

Fraud Detection: Vectors can be used to detect fraudulent transactions or activities by identifying unusual patterns.

Customer Segmentation: In marketing and CRM, vectors can help segment customers based on their behavior and preferences.

Document Clustering: Vectors can be used to group similar documents or articles into clusters.

Healthcare: In medical applications, vectors can represent patient records for finding similar medical cases or for predictive modeling.
